        "text = \"Pokémon, short for 'Pocket Monsters,' is an enduring global phenomenon that originated in Japan in 1996 with the release of the first video games by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise quickly expanded into trading card games, an animated television series, movies, toys, and a wide array of merchandise. At its core, Pokémon follows the adventures of trainers who capture, train, and battle creatures known as Pokémon, each possessing unique abilities and characteristics. The primary objective is to become a Pokémon Master by collecting and battling with various Pokémon, aiming to defeat powerful opponents and gym leaders to earn badges and prestige. Central to the franchise's appeal is its blend of strategic gameplay and an emotional connection with the creatures, exemplified by iconic characters like Pikachu, Charizard, and legendary Pokémon such as Mewtwo. The animated series, notably featuring Ash Ketchum and his steadfast companion Pikachu, has captivated audiences for decades, showcasing themes of friendship, perseverance, and teamwork. Pokémon’s cultural impact is immense, fostering community-driven events like Pokémon GO meetups and tournaments, which emphasize social interaction and exploration. With new generations of games and innovations, Pokémon continues to evolve, captivating fans of all ages and cementing its status as a cherished and nostalgic part of pop culture.\"\n"
